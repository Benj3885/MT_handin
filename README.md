Hand-in of paper:
Synthesizing Hard Training Data From Latent Hierarchical Representations

The code has not yet been cleaned up.

This project relies heavily on https://github.com/rosinality/vq-vae-2-pytorch and https://github.com/facebookresearch/ConvNeXt for model architectures and implementation.
Thanks to those authors:)
