Hand-in of master thesis:
Using VQ-VAE2 To Augment Images for Automatic Pharmaceutical Defect Inspection
Augmenting Hard Samples of Small Datasets for Improved Performance

The code has not yet been cleaned up.

This project relies heavily on https://github.com/rosinality/vq-vae-2-pytorch and https://github.com/facebookresearch/ConvNeXt for model architectures and implementation.
Thanks to those authors:)
